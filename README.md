## Guide to Blup documentation

This section is an overview of Blup documentation .&#x20;

Blup consists of three major sections that are as follows:

1. **BlupDesigner** ‚Äì This is where you create your designs or UI(user interface), with complete flexibility. It is the heart of your Blup apps.
2. **BlupLightning** ‚Äì It is a logic system where you can create your logic around the designs and interactions created in BlupDesigner and the backend. It supports a wide range of [nodes ](broken-reference)from variables like strings, integers to SDKs hosted on [`pub.dev`](https://www.pub.dev).
3. **BlupSheets** ‚Äì It is a pre-built backend system built on top of AWS. It provides powerful SQL-type queries that are easy to understand and super fast to use. It supports real-time queries to build real-time applications like chat apps or collaboration tools.

To get the most out of blup we recommend you go through the documentation in the following order:&#x20;
