**Design** helps you to design stunning & creative user interfaces of the pages for your applications seamlessly.

![Deign](<../../.gitbook/assets/Blup Design.png>)

Certainly! Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the different panels in **Design**:

1. [**Blup Top Bar**](blup-top-bar.md): Located at the top of the interface, the Blup Top Bar provides essential functions and tools. It often includes options for saving, exporting, and managing your project.
2. [**Blup Menu Bar**:](blup-menu-bar.md) Positioned just below the Blup Top Bar, the Blup Menu Bar offers additional commands and settings. You‚Äôll find various menus related to file management, editing, and preferences here.
3. [**Pages/Layers Panel**](pages-layers-panel.md): This panel resides on the left side of the workspace. It allows you to manage pages, layers, and other organizational elements. You can create, rename, and rearrange pages or layers as needed.
4. [**Toolkit**](tools-section.md): The Toolkit is situated on the pasteboard (the main working area). It contains tools for drawing, selecting, and manipulating objects. You‚Äôll find tools like pens, shapes, and text here.
5. [**Properties Panel**](properties-panel/): On the right side, the Properties panel displays the properties and attributes of selected objects. Adjustments related to color, stroke, opacity, and other properties can be made here.
6. [**Page Canvas**](page-canvas.md): The central area of the workspace is the Page Canvas. This is where you create and arrange your designs. It‚Äôs the canvas where your artistic vision comes to life!

Feel free to explore each section further, and if you have any specific questions about any of these panels, feel free to ask! üòä
