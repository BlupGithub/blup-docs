# Right-Click Menu in Design

The Right-Click Menu in **Design** provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for efficiently managing and manipulating components within your project.

You just have to right-click in Design, the menu will appear.

### **Copy, Paste, and Delete**

#### Copy

Duplicates the selected component, including its entire structure such as containers, texts, and widgets. This feature is handy for replicating existing components within your design.

#### **Paste**

Inserts the previously copied component as a new independent instance. This allows for the creation of duplicates without affecting existing components, fostering flexibility in design.

#### **Delete**

Removes the selected component from the UI, deleting it entirely—a crucial function for component management and cleanup.

### **Copy and Paste Properties**

#### **Copy Properties**

Copies all properties of the selected component, excluding height, width, and widget-specific properties. This feature is useful for transferring styles and settings between components.

#### **Paste Properties**

Applies the copied properties to the selected component. This allows for the efficient transfer of styling and configuration settings.

### **Copy Page, Paste Page, and Delete Page**

#### **Copy Page**

Duplicates the current page, facilitating the replication of entire layouts or structures.

#### **Paste Page**

Inserts the copied page as a new page, allowing for the seamless duplication of entire pages within your project.

#### **Delete Page**

Removes the current page and opens the last page before it. Useful for page management and navigation.

### **Sent Backward/Forward**

#### **Sent Forward**

Brings the selected component one layer above its current position in the layer hierarchy, adjusting the visual stacking order.

#### **Send Backward**

Pushes the selected component one layer below its current position in the layer hierarchy.

### **Sent to Front/Back**

#### **Sent to Front**

Brings the selected component to the top layer of the UI, making it visually the foremost element.

#### **Sent to Back**

Pushes the selected component to the bottom layer of the UI, making it the visually rearmost element.

### **Group/Un-group**

#### **Group**

Groups one or more components together, creating a single top-level layer. Grouping facilitates the management of related elements as a unified entity.

#### **Ungroup**

Removes layers from the selected group, allowing for the disassociation of components within a group.

### **ScrollView/Un-ScrollView**

#### **ScrollView**

Converts the currently selected component into a ScrollView—a view group used to make vertically scrollable views. Useful for creating scrollable sections within your design.

#### **Un-ScrollView**

Undo the ScrollView operation, reverting the selected component to its original state.

### **PageListView/Un-PageListView**

#### **PageListView**

Creates a ListView of pages, allowing you to map indexes of the pages to different components. Users can navigate through these pages using the designated components.

#### **Un-PageListView**

Undoes the PageListView operation, reverting the selected component to its original state before the ListView of pages is applied.
