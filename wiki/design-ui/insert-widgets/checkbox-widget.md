# CheckBox Widget

Checkbox widget is used to represent a toggleable option with two states: checked and unchecked. Users can tap the checkbox to toggle its state.

To utilize an CheckBox in your Flutter UI, adhere to these steps:

**1.** Drag the CheckBox widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the CheckBox by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right.
