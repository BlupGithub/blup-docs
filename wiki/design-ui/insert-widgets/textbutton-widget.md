# Text Button Widget

TextButton widget is used to create a text-based button that responds to user taps. It provides a simple, flat button style with text and optional icons.

To integrate a TextButton Widget into your UI, follow these steps:

**1.** Drag the TextButton widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the TextButton by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right. You can modify properties such as text, style, color, and onPressed callback to define its appearance and behavior.

**3.** Also you can give Ellipsis on over flow of the text, or can add selectable text.
