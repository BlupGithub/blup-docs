Integrating an iOS-style Timer widget into your UI is simple. Follow these steps to make it happen:

**1.** Drag the IOS Timer widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the IOS Timer by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right.

**3.**  Additionally, you can select the mode and theme type of the Timer. The mode determines whether the Timer displays HoursMinutes, MinutesSeconds or HourMinuteSecond, while the theme type controls the visual style of the Timer.
