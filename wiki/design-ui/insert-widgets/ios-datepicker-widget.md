Integrating an iOS-style DatePicker widget into your UI is simple. Follow these steps to make it happen:

**1.** Drag the IOS DatePicker widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the IOS DatePicker by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right.

**3.** Additionally, you can select the mode and theme type of the DatePicker. The mode determines whether the DatePicker displays dates, times, or both, while the theme type controls the visual style of the DatePicker.
