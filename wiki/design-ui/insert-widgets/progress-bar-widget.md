Integrating a Progress Bar into your UI is essential for indicating progress or loading states to the user. Follow these steps to utilize it effectively:

**1.** Drag the Alert Progress bar widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the Progress Bar by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right. You can modify properties such as size, position, color, and style to match your UI design and convey the desired visual representation of progress.

**3.** Use the Progress Bar to display progress or loading status to the user. You can update the progress value dynamically based on the progress of a task or operation in your application.
