To integrate a TextField Widget into your UI, follow these steps:

**1.** Drag the TextField widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the TextField by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right.

**3.** Additionally, you can enhance the TextField by adding error text, specifying the keyboard type, applying text overflow ellipsis, or configuring it as a password field to hide the entered text.

**-** To add error text, you can set the errorText property to display error messages when validation fails.
**-** To specify the keyboard type, you can set the keyboardType property to TextInputType to define the type of keyboard layout.
**-** To apply text overflow ellipsis, you can set the maxLines property to limit the number of lines displayed and set the overflow property to TextOverflow.ellipsis.
**-** To configure it as a password field, you can set the obscureText property to true to hide the entered text.
