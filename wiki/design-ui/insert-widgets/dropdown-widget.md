# DropDown Menu Widget

Dropdown widget is used to display a dropdown menu with a list of selectable options. Users can choose one option from the list by tapping on the dropdown button, and the selected option is displayed as the current value of the dropdown.

Integrating a DropDown Menu widget into your UI is straightforward. Follow these steps to make it happen:

**1.** Drag the DropDown widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the DropDown dialog by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right.

**3.** Populate the DropDown Menu with the list of data from the edit section that you want to show. You can provide a list of items to be displayed in the menu, and users can select an item from the list.
