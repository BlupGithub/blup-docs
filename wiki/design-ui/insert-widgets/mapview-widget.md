Integrating a MapView into your UI is a great way to add interactive maps to your application. Follow these steps to utilize it effectively:

**1.** Drag the MapView widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Obtain a Map API key from the Google Maps API and add it to the edit section. This key is necessary for accessing Google Maps services.

**3.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the MapView by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right. You can enable functionalities such as zoom in, zoom out, and zoom gestures to enhance user interaction with the map.
