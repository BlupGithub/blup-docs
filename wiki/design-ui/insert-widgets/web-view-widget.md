To integrate a WebView into your UI, follow these steps:

**1.** Drag the Web View widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the Web View by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right.

**3.**  Provide the URL of the web page you want to display in the WebView by setting the initialUrl property in the editing panel.
