# Date Picker Widget

DatePicker Widget from the Insert is used to display a date picker dialog. This allows users to select a date from a calendar-style interface.

Integrating a DatePicker widget into your UI is simple. Follow these steps to make it happen:

**1.** Drag the DatePicker widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the Alert dialog by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right.

**3.** Additionally, you can enhance the DatePicker by specifying properties such as initial date, minimum date, and maximum date. These properties allow you to control the range of dates available for selection and set a default date.
