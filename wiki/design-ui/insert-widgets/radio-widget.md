# Radio Widget

Radio widget is used to create radio buttons, which allow users to select one option from a set of mutually exclusive options. Radio buttons are typically used when there are a limited number of choices and only one selection is allowed at a time.

To utilize an Radio Widget in your Flutter UI, adhere to these steps:

**1.** Drag the Radio widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the Radio Widget by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right. You can modify properties such as color, size, and shape to match your UI design.

**3.** Implement logic to dynamically control the value of the Radio widget. You can achieve this by binding the value property of the Radio widget to a boolean variable in your code. Based on user interactions or application state changes, update the boolean variable to true or false accordingly. This will dynamically reflect the selected state of the Radio widget.
