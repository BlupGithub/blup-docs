# Switch Widget

Switch widget is used to create a toggle switch that allows users to toggle between two states: on and off. It's commonly used to represent binary options such as enabling/disabling a feature or setting.

To integrate a Switch Widget into your UI, follow these steps:

**1.** Drag the Switch widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.**  Customize the appearance and behavior of the Switch by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right. You can modify properties such as color, size, and shape to match your UI design. Change the color according to your needs by adjusting the activeColor and inactiveTrackColor properties.
