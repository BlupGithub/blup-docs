Integrating a Lottie animation into your UI is straightforward. Follow these steps to make it happen:

**1.** Drag the Lottie widget from the Insert menu and drop it into your desired location within your UI.

**2.**Provide the URL of the Lottie animation file in the URL section of the editing panel. This URL should point to the location of the Lottie animation file.

**3.** Customize the appearance and behavior of the Lottie animation by adjusting its properties in the editing section on the right. You can modify properties such as size, position, Border to match your UI design and requirements.
