To navigate between pages in Blup, follow these steps:

**1.** Select the element from your UI (e.g., a button) that you want to use for navigation.

**2.** Right-click on the selected element and choose "Add Logics" from the context menu.

**3.** Attach an "On Click" event to the function associated with the selected element.

**4.** Connect the "On Click" event to the page navigator.

**5.** Choose the destination page from the dropdown menu in the page navigator.
