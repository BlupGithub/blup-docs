# Blup Code Editor



Letâ€™s explore the **Code Editor** section in **Blup**, your Low Code IDE for Flutter app development. ðŸš€

Our versatile code editor is designed to empower developers with the flexibility to code in any language by supporting various file extensions.

Whether youâ€™re crafting Flutter widgets or diving into backend logic, Blupâ€™s intuitive and dynamic code editor ensures a seamless and efficient coding experience.&#x20;

Explore the possibilities and streamline your development process with Blupâ€™s adaptable code editing capabilities.

The Code Editor is divided into two parts. Letâ€™s understand each one of them in detail:

1. [**File Explorer:**](page-1.md) Located on the left side of the editor, the file explorer resembles what youâ€™d find in tools like Android Studio or Visual Studio Code. It serves as a gateway to your project files.
2. [**Editor Area:** ](page-2.md)This is your coding space, functioning like a traditional editor with a custom-built color scheme for both light and dark modes, enhancing readability and appearance.
