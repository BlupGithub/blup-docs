# UI Nodes

## UI nodes Overview

Nodes present in this section are one of the most important and widely used nodes. They are not present in the arsenal panel in blup lightning, rather they are generated automatically by blup from the designer section itself.&#x20;

These nodes help you to connect the UI with actual Logic, or we can say that they act as a bridge between the blup Designer UI and Blup Lightning logics section. These nodes help you to capture user events like on click etc. and create logic for these events.

There are four types of UI nodes:

* [Rectangle UI Node](rectangle-ui-node.md)
* [Group UI Node](group-ui-node.md)
* [Text UI Node](text-ui-node.md)
* [List UI Node](list-ui-node.md)
