# Function Node Section

All the nodes that help you achieve some functionality are present under this section for example upload files, authentication, payments etc.

Now, Let's go over each node in this section.

## Function Node

![](../../.gitbook/assets/function.png)

This Node helps you to generate the function in which you can add some input argument and these arguments are available as functions output. To add an argument just click on the add input button which will add an input node point and you can add any type of input node.

On it's own this node doesnâ€™t serve much purpose but this node is very helpful when combined with some other nodes from the function section.

## File Picker Node

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/file picker.png>)

This node helps to pick a file from your device for example, you want to pick an image that is present in the gallery of your phone. You can achieve this functionality easily with the help of this node.

To achieve this define the type of file you want to pick from the device.

If you want to pick multiple files at once check the Allow multiple files checkbox at the bottom of the node.

### How to Use File Picker Node

**Step1:** Get the File Picker node from the arsenal in blup lightning.

**Step2:** Choose the type of file you want to pick for example, if you want to pick images then choose the images only option from the drop-down list.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">Note: If you want to allow the user to choose multiple files then check the Allow multiple files checkbox at bottom of the node.</mark>
{% endhint %}

**Step3**: Now to get the desired output like a file path or file name, click OnFilePicked output node point and stretch it. As soon you leave it, a function node point is generated which consist of output node point like file type, file name, file path.

Now to run the file picker node OnClick of a button just connect the OnClick node point to your run input node point.

## File Uploader To BSS Node

This node helps you to upload files \[any type] exclusively to the blupsheets database, if you want to upload files to the servers you can use the other node TUS file uploader. This node is mostly used in pair with the file picker node to first pick the file from the device storage and then click upload it to the blupsheets database.

### Components Of Node

<table><thead><tr><th width="219"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Run input node point</strong></td><td>This input node point acts as a starting point for the node to perform its functionality.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>List of File paths</strong></td><td>This input node point takes a list of files path to be uploaded into the blupsheets database.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OnUploadSuccess()</strong></td><td>This output node helps you to execute any logic if you uploading is successfully done. </td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">Note: To get an additional output node point it needs to be stretched.</mark>
{% endhint %}

<table><thead><tr><th width="209"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>OnUploadingFailuire</strong></td><td>This output node is used to execute any logic if your uploading failed.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OnUploading</strong></td><td>This output node point performs some logic while your data is being uploaded to the database.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### How to Use File Uploader To BSS Node

**Step 1:** Get the file uploader BSS node from the arsenal panel in blup lightning.

**Step 2:** Provide the run trigger from where you want to run the node functionality in your case that can be on click of a button or we can bind this node with the file picker node.

**Step 3:** Provide the second input which is a list of file paths for which, if you directly know the file paths you can provide the list of file paths or you can use the file picker node for this.

**Step 4:** To get the download URL of the file uploaded you need to stretch the onUploadsucces output node point, as soon as you do it you can see a new function node is generated which consist of a list of download URL.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note: If you want to perform some functionality if uploads fail can use the OnUploadFailure output node point**
{% endhint %}

Similarly, if you want to perform some logic while your file is being uploaded you can use the onUploading node point this point also provides you additional node points like progress or current index etc.&#x20;

## TUS File Uploader Node

![](../../.gitbook/assets/tus-file-uploader.png)

The functionality performed by this node is very similar to the file Uploader BSS node the major difference is that this node helps you to upload the file anywhere like it's your own server.

### Components of file Uploader node to BSS

<table><thead><tr><th width="222"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Run input node point</strong></td><td>This input node point acts as a starting point for the node to perform its functionality.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>List of File paths</strong> </td><td>This input node point takes a list of files path which you want to upload.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Upload to Url</strong></td><td>This input node point is used to provide the URL where you want to upload your file like the endpoint to your server.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OnUploadSuccess()</strong></td><td>This output node helps you to execute any logic when your uploading is successfully done. If you want to get additional output node points like download Url to files, it needs to be stretched.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OnUploadingFailuire()</strong> </td><td>This output node is used to execute any logic if your uploading failed and similar to onUploadingSuccess if you want to get additional output node points you have to stretch it.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OnUploading()</strong></td><td>This output node point helps you to perform some logic while your data is being uploaded to the database, similar to onUploadingSuccess if you want to get additional output node points you have to stretch it.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## URI Encode Node

![](../../.gitbook/assets/uri-encode.png)

This node is used to encode the URI. Just pass the URI which you want to encode and from the result output node you will get encoded URI

Why we encode URI - when your URL consists of some spaces or special characters it can lead to a problem while executing the API. To avoid any such problems we use an encoding.

### Components Of Node

<table><thead><tr><th width="168"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Input </td><td> This node point is used to take the URI that you want to encode.</td></tr><tr><td>Use run trigger checkbox</td><td> This check box helps you to add a run trigger to the node.</td></tr><tr><td>Output</td><td>This output node point provides the result of the encoded URI which you have passed in the input node point.</td></tr></tbody></table>

## Share Node

![](../../.gitbook/assets/share.png)

This node is used to share files with other apps.

## Comment Node

![](../../.gitbook/assets/coment.png)

This node is used for putting any short note or a simple piece of information. To put a note in the node just use the Input box provided in the node and drag anywhere in the blup lightning.
