# Function Node Section

All the nodes that help you achieve some functionality are present under this section for example upload files, authentication, payments etc.

Now, Let's go over each node in this section.

![](../../.gitbook/assets/function.gif)


## Function Node

![](../../.gitbook/assets/fxn.png)

This function node generator allows you to create custom functions with dynamic input arguments. You can add input parameters by clicking the "Add Input" button, which creates input nodes. These input nodes represent the arguments that the function takes.

Once you've added input nodes, you can use them within the function's body. This tool is particularly useful when combined with other function nodes, allowing you to create versatile and tailored functions for various purposes.

While the node itself may seem basic, its power lies in its ability to create flexible and customizable functions tailored to specific requirements or tasks.


## File Picker Node

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/file-picker.png>)

This node facilitates the selection of files from your device. For instance, if you want to choose an image from your phone's gallery, this node allows you to do so effortlessly.

You can specify the type of file you want to pick from your device. Additionally, if you need to select multiple files simultaneously, you can enable the "Allow multiple files" option located at the bottom of the node.

### How to Use File Picker Node

**Step1:**  In Blup Logics, navigate to the arsenal and select the "File Picker" node.

**Step2:** Choose the type of file you wish to select. For example, if you're selecting images, pick the "Images Only" option from the dropdown list.

**Step3**: To obtain the desired output, such as file path or file name, click on the "OnFilePicked" output node and stretch it. Upon releasing, a function node will be generated containing output nodes like file type, file name, and file path.

To trigger the file picker node when a button is clicked, simply connect the "OnClick" node to the appropriate input node for running the process.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">Note: If you want to allow users to select multiple files, check the "Allow multiple files" checkbox located at the bottom of the node.</mark>
{% endhint %}

## File Uploader To BSS Node

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/file-uploder-bss.png>)


This node facilitates the exclusive uploading of files (of any type) to the Blupsheets database. If you need to upload files to servers, consider using the TUS file uploader node instead.

Typically, this node is paired with the file picker node. First, use the file picker node to select the desired file from your device storage. Then, click the upload button to transfer the selected file to the Blupsheets database.

This workflow provides a straightforward method for uploading files to the Blupsheets database, allowing seamless integration with other nodes for various tasks.

### Components Of Node

<table><thead>  <tr>
      <th>Component</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Run input node point</strong></td><td>Starting point for the node's functionality.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>List of File paths</strong></td><td>Takes a list of file paths to be uploaded to the Blupsheets database.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OnUploadSuccess()</strong></td><td>Executes logic upon successful file upload.
</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OnUploadingFailuire</strong></td><td>Executes logic if the file upload fails.
</td></tr><tr><td><strong>OnUploading</strong></td><td>Executes logic while the file is being uploaded to the database.
</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">Note: To get an additional output node point it needs to be stretched.</mark>
{% endhint %}

### How to Use File Uploader To BSS Node

**Step 1:** Get the file uploader BSS node from the arsenal panel in blup logics.

**Step 2:** Provide the run trigger from where you want to run the node functionality in your case that can be on click of a button or we can bind this node with the file picker node.

**Step 3:** Provide the second input which is a list of file paths for which, if you directly know the file paths you can provide the list of file paths or you can use the file picker node for this.

**Step 4:** To get the download URL of the file uploaded you need to stretch the onUploadsucces output node point, as soon as you do it you can see a new function node is generated which consist of a list of download URL.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note: If you want to perform some functionality if uploads fail can use the OnUploadFailure output node point**
{% endhint %}

Similarly, if you require logic execution while the file is being uploaded, use the OnUploading output node, which also provides additional node points like progress or current index.&#x20;

## TUS File Uploader Node

![](../../.gitbook/assets/tus-file-uploder.png)

The functionality of this node is similar to the File Uploader BSS node, with the key difference being that it allows you to upload files to any location, such as your own server.
