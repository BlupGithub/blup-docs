# Helper Nodes

Helper Nodes in Blup are essential for enhancing your application's logic and functionality. They provide specific actions on variable nodes, making data management and manipulation easier.

## Helper Nodes Overview

This section includes helper functions for handling variables. These functions assist in performing specific actions on variable nodes.

For additional details, you can navigate directly to the desired nodes by clicking on the respective node below.

* [Integer Node](integers-nodes.md)
* [Double Node](double-nodes.md)
* [Boolean Node](boolean-nodes.md)
* [Date-Time Node](date-time-nodes.md)
* [Json Node](json-nodes.md)
* [List Node](list-nodes.md)
* [Map Node](map-nodes.md)
* [String Node](string-nodes.md)
* [Duration Node](duration-nodes.md)
