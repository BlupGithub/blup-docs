## BlupSheets

BlupSheets is a powerful GUI-based database that is built from ground zero to work hand-in-hand with blup. It is built on top of AWS so your data is highly secured and all your data is highly available, so you can load/save data into BlupSheets.

For example - suppose you are building apps that can store the data of students \[student management app], then you can define a table with column-like student id \[number], student name \[single line text], student department \[single line text], student date of birth \[date and time].
