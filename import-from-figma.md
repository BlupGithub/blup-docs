# Import from Figma

There are some steps to bring your Figma file inside Blup.

Import your Figma files directly into Blup with ease! Follow these simple steps to get your designs into Blup in no time. üöÄ

### **Step 1: Copy the File ID from the URL**

Open your Figma file in a browser. Look at the URL and find the text after '.../file/' and before the next '/...'. This is your File ID. Copy it! üìã

**Example**: If your URL is `https://www.figma.com/file/abc12345/your-design-file`, you need to copy `abc12345`.

### Step 3: Create a Token from Figma

Now, you need a token to allow Blup to access your Figma file. In Figma, go to your account settings and generate a personal access token. This token is essential for the import process. üîë
