1\. **Set Up Splash Screen:** Navigate to your app settings. Look for the option to set up the splash screen.

2\. **Add Logo and Background Color:** Within the splash screen settings, upload your app's logo or icon. You can also specify the background color you want to display during the splash screen.

3\. **Save Changes:** Once you've uploaded the logo and set the background color, save the changes.

4\. **Run the App:** Now, whenever you run your app on a device or emulator, the splash screen will automatically appear with the logo and background color you've configured.
