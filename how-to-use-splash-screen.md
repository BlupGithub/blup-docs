1\. **Set Up Splash Screen:** Navigate to your app settings. Look for the option to set up the splash screen.

2\. **Add Logo and Background Color:** Within the splash screen settings, upload your app's logo or icon. You can also specify the background color you want to display during the splash screen.

3\. **Save Changes:** Once you've uploaded the logo and set the background color, save the changes.

4\. **Run the App** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è**:** Now, whenever you run your app on a device or emulator, the splash screen will automatically appear with the logo and background color you've configured.

### Tips for an Effective Splash Screen

* **Keep it Simple:** A clean and simple splash screen with your logo and a solid background color is often the most effective.
* **Brand Consistency:** Ensure that the logo and background color align with your overall brand identity.
* **Test on Multiple Devices:** Make sure the splash screen looks good on different screen sizes and resolutions.
